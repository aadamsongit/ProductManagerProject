#ProductManagerProject

// This project was created with Python for the backend, specifically a Flask virtual environment and a mySQL database.
// For the frontend, I used HTML, Bootstrap, and hardcoded CSS.
// The website allows a user to add products to an inventory. I designed it with vendors in mind (i.e. grocery stores, as I was somewhat inspired by a grocery store management app), but individual personal users can also use it to inventory household goods and items of any kind.
// As a coder, the purpose of the project is to demontrate my ability to create and execute CRUD functions w/HTTP verbs, as well as my ability to create a nice frontend UX/UI design using Bootstrap and CSS.
