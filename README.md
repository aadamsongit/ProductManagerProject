#ProductManagerProject

// You may need to run "pip install cryptography" for the cryptography package. It's a simple fix and the command line should provide instructions. I run into this
// sometime with the Flask virtual environment.

// This project was created with Python for the backend, specifically a Flask virtual environment and a MySQL database.
// For the frontend, I used HTML, Bootstrap, and hardcoded CSS.
// The website allows a user to add products to an inventory. I was inspired by a similar grocery management application I saw on YouTube, but I coded this one more
// in line with the Python MVC folder structure we were taught at Coding Dojo.
